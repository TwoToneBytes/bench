===========

We've open sourced the Benchwarmer Chrome Extention!  Feel free to fork the shot of it and help us build the best Chrome extention for the Dribbble community.  Currently benchwarmer shows the latest Dribbble shots everytime you open up a new tab. It is a simple extension that replaces your "New Tab" screen with a one that shows you the latest shots from your following feed, popular, debuts or everyone.

We'll be expanding the documentation here as time goes on.

You can download the extention from the Chrome store here:
